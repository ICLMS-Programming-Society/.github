# Programming Society – Getting Started
In Programming Society, we will be using a standard set of IDEs and collaborative tools to make it easiest to work as a group, but also so that anyone can help anyone else easily, as everyone will understand how to use the same software. We will use Microsoft Visual Studio Code as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and GitHub as a way for both working as a team, and also sharing code/data.

## Setting up GitHub
You will require a GitHub account. You can sign up for one at https://github.com/signup. Please use your ICLMS email address to sign up for GitHub, and give yourself a username that will let other people know it’s you (ie. ojas-sharma-iclms) – this will help when working as a team.

Once you’ve set your account up, and you have verified your email address, tell a member of the ICLMS Programming Society leadership team your email address, and we will add you to the GitHub organization. If you are experienced at using GitHub, then feel free to have a look around the repositories – we will create a repository for each group project that we will work on, and some repositories for mini courses. If you are not familiar with GitHub, ask someone who is experienced.

## Setting up Visual Studio Code
Microsoft Visual Studio Code is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that we will be using. If you do not already have it, you can install it at https://code.visualstudio.com/download. It is free, and a very simple, but powerful IDE. It’s available for Windows, Mac and Linux. From here, I would recommend logging into your GitHub account in Visual Studio (VS) Code, even if you are a beginner. <img src="/assets/image.png" align="left" width="200px"/>Click on the ‘extensions’ section of the toolbar, and search for GitHub, choosing the ‘GitHub Pull Requests and Issues’ extension. Insall it, and a GitHub logo will appear on the toolbar. Click that, and sign into your GitHub account.

## Using Visual Studio Code
On your computer, create a new folder, and name it something like ‘Programming Society’. Then, in VS Code, click ‘File > Open Folder’ and open the folder you just created. This will now show up the in the explorer (multiple pages icon). From here, you can make new files, and they will save inside the folder you created. You’re all set, happy coding!
